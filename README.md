# Flower Classification Project

This project involves training a deep learning model to classify different types of flowers from images. The project includes scripts to train the model and a Streamlit web application to make predictions using the trained model.

## Project Overview

1. **modeltraining.py**: This script trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using MobileNetV2 to classify different flower types.
2. **application.py**: This script provides a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload an image of a flower and get predictions for the flower type.

## Requirements

- tensorflow==2.15.0
- streamlit==1.37.0
- pillow==10.4.0
- matplotlib==3.7.2
- numpy==1.24.2

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
